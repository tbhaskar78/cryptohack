# cryptohack

This is a collection of small tools which can be useful in crypto analysis and other related activities. I am currently in the process of evolving these as I learn more about it. 
Could be used for various crypto challenges and CTF events as well. 

As of now, I do not have a vision for this project but it could evolve into a toolbox. Aim to write similar code both in Python and C/C++.

Happy learning!
